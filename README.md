A simple application for playing rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock

# Pre requisites

You should have node.js currently installed on your machine. If not, please download and install it from the official website:

[node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

I developed all the application using the current versions on my system:

- node.js: **6.11.0**
- npm: **4.5.0**

If you may have installed a prior version of node.js, and you need to install also the new version, you can use **Node Version Manager** in order to manage multiple versions of node.js and simply switch among them through **nvm**

`node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update`
